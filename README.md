<!--

Unlikely to be of any use to anyone but me but some shoddy javascript to take the RAW newsletter and turn it into a blob that I can drop into the emailer.

FORMAT FOR EMAIL:

Ideally I'll add a third bit to format it for the site version but not today.

# B3TA NEWSLETTER WRAPPER

Takes the newsletter and does a hard wrap that's used for the website version.

# PATREON THANKER

Something I can drop the patreon CSV into so that that it'll spit out the thanks I need for the bottom of the newsletter
